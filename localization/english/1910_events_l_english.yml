 stance.1.1: "The Dual Alliance is purely to our detriment! The Junkers point to a much-necessary answer to the [SCOPE.sCulture('german_culture_scope').GetName] question."
    stance.1.1.tt: "The Junkers haven't exactly changed their stances on the Austrians ever since the Brothers' War. They point to the need to finally resolve the "[SCOPE.sCulture('german_culture_scope').GetName] Question" by strong-arming the Austrians, uniting all [SCOPE.sCulture('german_culture_scope').GetName] peoples under one empire.

They believe that only by defeating our rivals in an inevitable trial by fire can we ever cement our status as the hegemonic force in Europe, and perhaps the world."
 stance.1.4: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('ger_nation_scope').GetName] shall only prosper by maintaining the largely beneficial status quo, and playing it to our advantage."
